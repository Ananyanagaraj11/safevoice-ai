## 🧠 About SafeVoice

**SafeVoice AI** is a web-based application designed to help promote **women’s safety and mental well-being**. It captures and analyzes voice conversations to detect signs of **emotional distress**, **verbal abuse**, and **toxic behavior** using artificial intelligence.

The system uses **Whisper** for speech-to-text and a transformer-based NLP model to extract **emotions** and **abuse patterns** — all processed **locally** with full respect for user privacy.
